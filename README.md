Media Player App
I have always had a passion for music, so my idea for the project is to make a music player app. I figured that making a music player would be fun and allow for me to explore and find out more things about python. After doing some research, I discovered that many music apps such as YouTube and Spotify use python in their coding. Spotify even goes into detail on how they use python. Here is the link for that article: https://labs.spotify.com/2013/03/20/how-we-use-python-at-spotify/. It was really interesting seeing how many apps are coded in python. It made me realize that python is a part of everyday lives whether we realize it or not.
Anybody will be able to use the media player app. It will be a simple app where people will be able to listen to music. Users will be able to  I would like to even add other features such as viewing music videos uploading videos/music content, but that may take too long and maybe difficult to make. There are many articles and code of how people used python to make a music player app. This is the code I found on a python music player app on GitHub https://github.com/surajsinghbisht054/Python-Media-Player/blob/master/Python%20Media%20Player%20Version%200.0.1/GUI.py.
